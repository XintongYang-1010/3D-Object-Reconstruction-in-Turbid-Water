# 3D-Object-Reconstruction-in-Turbid-Water
Developed a temporal-multiplexing structured light system with polarization imaging to obtain dense and accurate target geometry information. Proposed an underwater turbidity removal network based on this system, mitigating the impact of underwater turbidity on imaging accuracy and quality.
